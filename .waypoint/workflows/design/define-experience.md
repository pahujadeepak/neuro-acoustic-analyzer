# Step 2/7: Define Core Experience

> Articulate the experience principles

## Objective

Define what the experience should BE, before defining what it looks like.

## Inputs Required

- Emotional needs from Step 1

## Outputs Produced

- Experience principles (3-5)
- Key moments defined

---

## Step 2: Define Core Experience

### Your Objective
Articulate the experience principles that will guide all design decisions.

### Facilitation Questions
1. **If this experience were a person, how would you describe their personality?**
2. **What 3 adjectives should users use to describe using this?**
3. **What's the "signature moment" - the thing that makes this memorable?**
4. **What should this NOT feel like?** (as important as what it should)

### Experience Principles Format
```
**[Principle Name]**
We believe: [value statement]
So we will: [design implication]
We will NOT: [anti-pattern]
```

### Key Moments to Define
- First impression (onboarding)
- Core action (main task completion)
- Success celebration
- Error recovery
- Return visit

### Output
3-5 experience principles that could guide any designer.

## Checkpoint

Before proceeding to the next step, confirm:

> **Could someone else design to these principles and get a similar feel?**


## Tips

- 💡 Principles should create tension - if everything aligns, they are too vague
- 💡 Anti-patterns are as valuable as patterns
- 💡 Test: would this principle cause a design argument? Good.
