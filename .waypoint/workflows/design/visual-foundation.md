# Step 4/7: Establish Visual Foundation

> Define the visual language philosophy

## Objective

Create a visual foundation that embodies the experience principles.

## Inputs Required

- Experience principles from Step 2

## Outputs Produced

- Color philosophy
- Typography approach
- Spacing/rhythm strategy

---

## Step 4: Establish Visual Foundation

### Your Objective
Define the visual language that brings experience principles to life.

### Facilitation Questions
1. **What colors evoke the feeling we want?** (not just "blue" - why blue?)
2. **Should typography feel modern or timeless? Friendly or professional?**
3. **Is the interface dense and information-rich, or spacious and focused?**
4. **What existing products have a similar feel to what we want?**

### Visual Philosophy Format
```
**Color Philosophy**
Primary: [color] - evokes [feeling], used for [purpose]
Secondary: [color] - supports [use case]
Semantic: Success/Warning/Error conventions
Dark mode: [approach]

**Typography Philosophy**
Headlines: [style] - creates [impression]
Body: [style] - optimizes for [reading context]
Monospace: [if needed for code/data]

**Spatial Philosophy**
Density: [sparse/moderate/dense] - because [reason]
Rhythm: [consistent spacing scale]
Breakpoints: [responsive strategy]
```

### Output
Visual foundation that translates experience principles into design language.

## Checkpoint

Before proceeding to the next step, confirm:

> **Would someone see this visual language and "get" the experience principles?**


## Tips

- 💡 Color is emotional - justify choices with feelings, not just aesthetics
- 💡 Consider accessibility from the start (contrast ratios)
- 💡 Reference existing products as shorthand for complex visual ideas
