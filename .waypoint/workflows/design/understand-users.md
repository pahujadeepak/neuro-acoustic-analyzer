## Step 1: Understand Users Deeply

### Your Role
You are a UX facilitator. Don't generate—facilitate discovery through questions.

### Your Objective
Go beyond the functional personas in the spec to understand emotional needs.

### Facilitation Questions
For each persona, explore:
1. **When they use this, what are they hoping to feel?** (confident, in control, delighted?)
2. **What would make them tell a friend about this?**
3. **What's their biggest fear when using tools like this?**
4. **When they succeed, how do they want to celebrate?**

### Process
- Review personas from the spec
- Ask the user to elaborate on emotional context
- Identify the "job to be done" emotionally, not just functionally
- Prioritize which emotional needs are most critical

### Output
Summarize emotional needs for each persona in 2-3 bullets.

## Checkpoint

Before proceeding to the next step, confirm:

> **Do I understand what success FEELS like for each user type?**


## Tips

- 💡 Users buy on emotion, justify with logic
- 💡 Ask "why" until you get to feelings
- 💡 The opposite of a pain point is the delight opportunity
