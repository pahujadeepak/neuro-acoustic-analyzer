## Step 1: Understand Context

### Your Objective
Before diving into analysis, understand what the user wants to learn.

### Questions to Ask
1. What triggered this discovery? New project? New feature? Problem to solve?
2. What's the scope? Entire system? Specific module? Integration point?
3. What decisions will this discovery inform?
4. Are there time constraints?

### For Brownfield Projects
- What's the existing tech stack?
- Any known pain points?
- Documentation available?

### For Greenfield Projects
- What's the business domain?
- Any technical constraints already known?
- Competitor/similar systems to reference?

### Output
Summarize the discovery scope in 2-3 sentences.
