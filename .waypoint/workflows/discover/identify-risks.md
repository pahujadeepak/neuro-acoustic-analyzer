# Step 3/4: Identify Risks & Constraints

> Surface risks, constraints, and hidden assumptions

## Objective

Uncover potential problems before they become blockers.

## Inputs Required

- Landscape overview from Step 2

## Outputs Produced

- Risk register
- Constraints list
- Assumptions documented

---

## Step 3: Identify Risks & Constraints

### Your Objective
Proactively identify what could go wrong or constrain our options.

### Risk Categories
- **Technical**: Legacy code, outdated dependencies, missing tests
- **Knowledge**: Undocumented systems, tribal knowledge, missing expertise
- **Integration**: External dependencies, API limitations, data migration
- **Timeline**: Deadlines, dependencies on other teams, seasonal factors
- **Resource**: Budget, team size, skill gaps

### For Each Risk
```
**Risk: [Title]**
Category: [Technical/Knowledge/Integration/Timeline/Resource]
Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
Likelihood: [High/Medium/Low]
Mitigation: [How to reduce risk]
```

### Constraints to Document
- Technical: Must use X technology, can't change Y
- Business: Budget limits, timeline requirements
- Organizational: Team structure, approval processes

## Checkpoint

Before proceeding to the next step, confirm:

> **Have I surfaced the key risks and constraints?**
