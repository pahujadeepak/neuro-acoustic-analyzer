# Step 1/3: Gather Context

> Understand what the user wants to build

## Objective

Collect enough information to understand the feature scope, target users, and business value.

## Inputs Required

- User feature request
- Optional discovery.md

## Outputs Produced

- Feature summary
- Target users identified
- Business value statement

---

## Step 1: Gather Context

### Your Objective
Understand the feature request deeply before defining anything formal.

### Questions to Explore
1. **What** is the user trying to build?
2. **Why** does this feature matter? What problem does it solve?
3. **Who** will use this feature?
4. **When** does this need to be delivered? Any constraints?
5. **How** does this fit with existing features?

### Process
- Ask clarifying questions (don't assume)
- Summarize your understanding back to the user
- Identify any dependencies on other features
- Note any constraints mentioned (technical, time, budget)

### Output Format
Summarize in a brief paragraph:
- What we're building
- Why it matters
- Who it's for
- Key constraints

## Checkpoint

Before proceeding to the next step, confirm:

> **Do I understand what we are building and why? Ready to define user personas?**


## Tips

- 💡 Ask "why" at least twice to get to the real need
- 💡 Look for unstated assumptions
- 💡 Identify success metrics early
