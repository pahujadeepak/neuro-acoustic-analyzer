# WayPoint Workflows

This directory contains step-by-step workflows for each development phase.

## Project Track: Solo Developer

**Quick iteration, minimal documentation, lightweight governance**

- Governance level: light
- Documentation: minimal
- Plan phase: Skipped (implement directly from spec)


Workflows have been adapted for this track - only relevant steps are included.

## How Workflows Work

Each workflow breaks a complex phase into small, focused steps:

1. **Steps are checkpointed** - You validate each step before proceeding
2. **Steps are interruptible** - Save progress and continue later
3. **Steps are composable** - Reuse across different workflows
4. **Steps have clear I/O** - Know what goes in and what comes out

## Available Workflows

### Specification (`/waypoint.specify`)
- **Agent**: product-manager
- **Steps**: 3
- **Description**: Create a comprehensive feature specification
- **Flow file**: `.waypoint/workflows/specify/_flow.yaml`

### Discovery (`/waypoint.discover`)
- **Agent**: analyst
- **Steps**: 4
- **Description**: Analyze existing codebase or explore problem space
- **Flow file**: `.waypoint/workflows/discover/_flow.yaml`

### UX Design (`/waypoint.design`)
- **Agent**: ux-designer
- **Steps**: 7
- **Description**: Create frontend/UX specification from a PRD
- **Flow file**: `.waypoint/workflows/design/_flow.yaml`

### Architecture (`/waypoint.architect`)
- **Agent**: architect
- **Steps**: 5
- **Description**: Create technical design for a specification
- **Flow file**: `.waypoint/workflows/architect/_flow.yaml`

### Planning (`/waypoint.plan`)
- **Agent**: scrum-master
- **Steps**: 4
- **Description**: Break technical design into executable tasks
- **Flow file**: `.waypoint/workflows/plan/_flow.yaml`


## Workflow State

When you start a workflow, state is tracked in `waypoint.manifest.yaml` under:

```yaml
workflows:
  active:
    specify:
      feature: "feature-name"
      currentStep: 0
      stepStatuses:
        step-1: completed
        step-2: in-progress
```

This allows resuming interrupted workflows.
