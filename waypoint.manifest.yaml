# WayPoint Project Manifest
#
# This file is the central registry for your WayPoint project.
# Claude reads this file first to understand project structure and state.
#
# Structure:
#   - project: Basic project info
#   - phases: Workflow phases with their agents and I/O patterns
#   - agents: Agent personas with their capabilities
#   - documents: Registry of specs, plans, and tasks with summaries
#
# Usage:
#   - waypoint init: Generates this file
#   - waypoint sync: Updates document registry from file system
#   - Phase commands: Read this to understand current state
#
# Tips:
#   - Add summaries and keywords when creating new documents
#   - Update status as documents move through workflow
#   - Use keywords for quick semantic lookup
